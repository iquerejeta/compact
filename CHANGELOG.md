## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.107 language version 0.18.1]

### Fixed

- A bug that allowed const statements binding patterns or multiple variables
  to appear in a single-statement context, e.g., the consequent or alternative
  of an `if` statement.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.106 language version 0.18.1]

### Added

- Selective module import and renaming, e.g.:
    `import { getMatch, putMatch as $putMatch } from Matching;`
      imports `getMatch` as `getMatch`, `putMatch` as `$putMatch`
    `import { getMatch, putMatch as originalPutMatch } from Matching prefix M$;`
      imports `getMatch` as `M$getMatch`, `putMatch` as `M$originalPutMatch`
  The original form of import is still supported:
    `import Matching;`
      imports everything from `Matching` under their unchanged export names
    `import Matching prefix M$;`
      imports everything from `Matching` with prefix M$

### Fixed

- A bug that sometimes caused impure circuits to be identified as pure
