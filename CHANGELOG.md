## [Compiler version 0.27.0, language version 0.19.0] - Branched 2025-11-19

This release includes all changes for compiler versions in the range 0.26.100
(inclusive) and 0.27.0 (exclusive); and language versions in the range 0.18.100
(inclusive) and 0.19.0.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.121 language version 0.18.103]

### Changed

- Changed the intermediate languages leading up to Lexpr to reflect that circuit
  and constructor bodies must be blocks rather than arbitrary statements.  reworked
  hoist-local-variables to avoid a dependency on a fluid variable.  These are not
  user-visible changes.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.120 language version 0.18.103]

### Changed

- Changed the (experimental, not yet announced) ZKIR v3 format to use symbolic
  names instead of indexes for instruction inputs and ouputs.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.119 language version 0.18.103]

### Fixed

- The type checker was not raising an exception for casts from Bytes<0> values
  to Field or Uint values and vice versa, which led to confusing downstream errors
  in some cases.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.118 language version 0.18.103]

### Added

- Four new kernel operations, `mintUnshielded`, `claimUnshieldedCoinSpend`, `incUnshieldedOutputs`, and
  `incUnshieldedInputs`.
- Eight new standard library functions, `mintUnshieldedToken`, `sendUnshielded`, `receiveUnshielded`,
  `unshieldedBalance`, `unshieldedBalanceLt`, `unshieldedBalanceGte`, `unshieldedBalanceGt`, `unshieldedBalanceLte`.

### Changed

- Updates the repository to use ledger `6.1.0-alpha.5`, i.e., `@midnight-ntwrk/onchain-runtime-v1` version `1.0.0-alpha.5`.
- Changes names like `QualifiedCoinInfo` and `CoinInfo` to be `QualifiedShieldedCoinInfo` and `ShieldedCoinInfo` to
  match the names in the new on-chain runtime.
- Renames standard library functions to distinguish between shielded and unshielded token utilities.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.117 language version 0.18.102]

### Fixed

- A bug in which types other than tuple, vector, and bytes do not result in an internal
  error when checking the bounds of an index.  This was an unreleased bug, that is,
  the bug was created in an unreleased version of the compiler.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.116 language version 0.18.102]

### Fixed

- A bug in which unimported modules enclosed in unimported modules are not processed
  to detect and report certain errors, including type errors.  While it is
  essentially harmless not to process unimported modules since code in unimported
  modules is never run, this fix potentially allows some issues to be detected
  earlier in the application development process.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.115 language version 0.18.102]

### Fixed

- A bug in which the compiler sometimes mentioned the same incompatible function
  more than once in the error message produced when no function with compatible
  generic or run-time parameters is found at a call site.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.114 language version 0.18.102]

### Changed

- The maximum representable unsigned integer has been reduced from the maximum value
  that fits in the number of _bits_ in a field to the maximum value that fits in the
  number of _bytes_ in a field.  This change is necessary because values that do not
  fit in the number of bytes in a field do not have a valid representation in the
  ledger.  Given that the maximum field value at present is between 2^254 and 2^255,
  the number of whole bytes representable by a field is 31, and the maximum unsigned
  value is (2^8)^31-1 = 2^248-1.

  This is a breaking change because programs that used unsigned integers between
  2^248 (inclusive) and 2^254 (exclusive) will no longer compile.  Though while they
  would previously have compiled, they would not necessarily have worked properly.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.113 language version 0.18.101]

### Fixed

- A bug in which some obviously unreachable statements were not being reported as such.
  This should be considered a breaking change since some programs that previously compiled
  will no longer compile due to this fix.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.112 language version 0.18.101]

### Changed

- `Uint` range end points are now exclusive rather than inclusive to match the
  range syntax for `for` ranges.  That is, `Uint<0..n>` is now interpreted as the
  set of all unsigned integers in the range 0 through `n-1`, e.g., `Uint<0..3>`
  represents the set {0, 1, 2} rather than the set {0, 1, 2, 3}.

- The runtime version has been bumped to 0.10.2.

- when passed the `--update-Uint-ranges` flag, `fixup-compact` now adjusts the
  end point of each Uint whose size is given by a range with a constant end point
  and issues a warning for each Uint whose size is given by a range when the end
  point is a generic-variable reference.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.111 language version 0.18.100]

### Fixed
- A bug in which Compact enums were generated as CJS enums instead of ESM enums. Previously, `index.js` might contain:

  ```javascript
  var Status;
  (function (Status) {
  Status[Status['Pending'] = 0] = 'Pending';
  // ...
  })(Status = exports.Status || (exports.Status = {}));
  ```

  for an enum `Status`. Now, `index.js` contains:

  ```javascript
  export var Status;
  (function (Status) {
    Status[Status['Pending'] = 0] = 'Pending';
    // ...
  })(Status || (Status = {}));
  ```

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.110 language version 0.18.100]

### Fixed
- An unreleased bug that was created during putting bounds on vectors/tuples/bytes

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.109 language version 0.18.100]

### Fixed

- A bug that could cause ledger operations or witness calls occurring
  in the test part of an `if` expresssion not to be reflected in the
  generated zkir circuit.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.108 language version 0.18.100]

### Fixed

- A bug in unreleased code that caused an internal error message
  about an invalid source object.
- Internal language version is now properly bumped to 0.18.100.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.107 language version 0.18.1]

### Fixed

- A bug that allowed const statements binding patterns or multiple variables
  to appear in a single-statement context, e.g., the consequent or alternative
  of an `if` statement.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.106 language version 0.18.1]

### Added

- Selective module import and renaming, e.g.:
    `import { getMatch, putMatch as $putMatch } from Matching;`
      imports `getMatch` as `getMatch`, `putMatch` as `$putMatch`
    `import { getMatch, putMatch as originalPutMatch } from Matching prefix M$;`
      imports `getMatch` as `M$getMatch`, `putMatch` as `M$originalPutMatch`
  The original form of import is still supported:
    `import Matching;`
      imports everything from `Matching` under their unchanged export names
    `import Matching prefix M$;`
      imports everything from `Matching` with prefix M$

### Fixed

- A bug that sometimes caused impure circuits to be identified as pure
