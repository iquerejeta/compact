### Added

- Selective module import and renaming, e.g.:
    `import { getMatch, putMatch as $putMatch } from Matching;`
      imports `getMatch` as `getMatch`, `putMatch` as `originalPutMatch`
    `import { getMatch, putMatch as originalPutMatch } from Matching prefix M$;`
      imports `getMatch` as `M$getmatch`, `putMatch` as `M$originalPutMatch`
  The original form of import is still supported:
    `import Matching;`
      imports everything from `Matching` under its unchanged export name
    `import Matching prefix M$;`
      imports everything from `Matching` with prefix M$
