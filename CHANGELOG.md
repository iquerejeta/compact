## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.110 language version 0.18.101]

### Changed

- `Uint` range end points are now exclusive rather than inclusive to match the
  range syntax for `for` ranges.  That is, `Uint<0..n>` is now interpreted as the
  set of all unsigned integers in the range 0 through `n-1`, e.g., `Uint<0..3>`
  represents the set {0, 1, 2} rather than the set {0, 1, 2, 3}.

- when passed the `--update-Uint-ranges` flag, `fixup-compact` now adjusts the
  end point of each Uint whose size is given by a range with a constant end point
  and issues a warning for each Uint whose size is given by a range when the end
  point is a generic-variable reference.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.109 language version 0.18.100]

### Fixed

- A bug that could cause ledger operations or witness calls occurring
  in the test part of an `if` expresssion not to be reflected in the
  generated zkir circuit.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.108 language version 0.18.100]

### Fixed

- A bug in unreleased code that caused an internal error message
  about an invalid source object.
- Internal language version is now properly bumped to 0.18.100.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.107 language version 0.18.1]

### Fixed

- A bug that allowed const statements binding patterns or multiple variables
  to appear in a single-statement context, e.g., the consequent or alternative
  of an `if` statement.

## [Unreleased compiler version 0.26.106 language version 0.18.1]

### Added

- Selective module import and renaming, e.g.:
    `import { getMatch, putMatch as $putMatch } from Matching;`
      imports `getMatch` as `getMatch`, `putMatch` as `$putMatch`
    `import { getMatch, putMatch as originalPutMatch } from Matching prefix M$;`
      imports `getMatch` as `M$getMatch`, `putMatch` as `M$originalPutMatch`
  The original form of import is still supported:
    `import Matching;`
      imports everything from `Matching` under their unchanged export names
    `import Matching prefix M$;`
      imports everything from `Matching` with prefix M$

### Fixed

- A bug that sometimes caused impure circuits to be identified as pure
