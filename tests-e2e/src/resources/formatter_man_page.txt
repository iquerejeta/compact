Usage: format-compact <flag> ... <source-pathname> [ <target-pathname> ]

This program reformats the Compact source program in the file specified by
<source-pathname> and writes the reformatted program to <target-pathname>, if
specified, otherwise to standard output.  <target-pathname> may be the same
as <source-pathname>, in which case the source program is replaced with the
reformatted equivalent.

The following flags, if present, affect the formatter's behavior as follows:
  --help prints help text and exits.

  --version prints the compiler version and exits.

  --language-version prints the language version and exits.

  --vscode causes error messages to be printed on a single line so they are
    rendered properly within the VS Code extension for Compact.
