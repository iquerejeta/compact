Usage: fixup-compact <flag> ... <source-pathname> [ <target-pathname> ]

This program processes the Compact source program in the file specified by
<source-pathname>, attempts to update it to account for recent changes in the
Compact language, formats it, and writes the updated and reformatted program to
<target-pathname>, if specified, otherwise to standard output.  <target-pathname>
may be the same as <source-pathname>, in which case the source program is replaced
with the reformatted equivalent.  (Though we recommend that you direct the output
to a different file and compare it with the original, to verify that the changes
make sense.)

The following flags, if present, affect the tool's behavior as follows:
  --help prints help text and exits.

  --version prints the compiler version and exits.

  --language-version prints the language version and exits.

  --vscode causes error messages to be printed on a single line so they are
    rendered properly within the VS Code extension for Compact.
